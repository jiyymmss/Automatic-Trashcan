# Smart Trashbin

##  Overview
An Automatic Trashbin that automatically classifies placed waste on trashbin

##  Components
- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motors
- IR Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- LED
- ESP32 Cam
- Solar Panel
- 12v Rechargeable Lead-Acid Battery

##  Features
- Accurate waste classification using camera
- LED for status like (green for ready, yellow for full bin, red for low battery)

##  Challenges I Solved
- During building the trashbin where it ate most of my time and I end up passing the build work to the expert one in building structures to save time
- Camera misreading → adjusted threshold values for confidence
